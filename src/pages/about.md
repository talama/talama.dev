_AstroPaper-S_ is a fork of [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I designed and crafted this based on [my personal blog](https://blog.ziteh.dev/).

This theme is aimed to be accessible out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by
default and additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. So, see the documentation for more info.
